# PolishNotationInterpreter
Small Interpreter for Post-Fix Polish Notation I wrote.

      TODO: · = done, - = partially implemented, X = complete.

        NEW FEATURES:

            [X] Float Number Support
            
            [·] Negative Number Support

            [-] More OPERATORS(power is implemented, may implement factorials, sqrt, etc.)
